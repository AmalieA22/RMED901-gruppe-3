GROUP 3 EXAM


In the "scripts" folder you will find 4 scripts:
tidying_data.R
plotting_data.R
analysis_of_data.R
full_script.R
They should be run in the given order, except for full_script.R

You will also find a markdown report, detailing what we did, how we did it and why we did it for each script.

tidying_data.R tidies and wrangles the data by removing unnessecary columns, making new values, joining the datasets and makes a dataset that can be analyzed and plotted called data_wrangled. We also do some stratifications and explore the data in this script. This corresponds to days 5 & 6 of the course.

plotting_data.R creates 6 plots from data_wrangled. This corresponds to day 7 of the course.

analysis_of_data.R performs 4 analysis on data_wrangled. This corresponds to day 8 of the exam.

full_script.R includes just about all the code we have written as part of days 5 and 6 of the exam, including some of our trial and error to produce the pipelines. tidying_data.R was the original file we worked in, so if you are interested in the change log for the coding you have to through tidying_data.R


For each day, and each script, we have divided the work into four roughly equal portions between the members of the group. When we were done individually we worked together to create pipelines and coherent presentations of our work.

*An extra comment regarding the files:*
We are aware that looking through the history of changes might be a bit of struggle, and we are sorry that the merges flipped around some stuff. If you look at an earlier file, commits made on the 15th of september or earlier (such as version 3c159e5) still contain most of the original code, with the "original" contributors. Merges done on the 21st and 22nd of september have shorter versions of the files.
