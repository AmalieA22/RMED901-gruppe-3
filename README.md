GROUP 3 EXAM


In the "scripts" folder you will find 3 scripts:
tidying_data.R
plotting_data.R
analysis_of_data.R
They should be run in the given order.

You will also find a markdown report, detailing what we did, how we did it and why we did it for each script.

tidying_data.R tidies and wrangles the data by removing unnessecary columns, making new values, joining the datasets and makes a dataset that can be analyzed and plotted called data_wrangled. We also do some stratifications and explore the data in this script. This corresponds to days 5 & 6 of the exam.

plotting_data.R creates a set of plots from data_wrangled. This corresponds to day 7 of the exam.

analysis_of_data.R does a set of analysis on data_wrangled. This correspons to day 8 of the exam.

For each day, and each script, we have divided the work into four roughly equal portions between the members of the group. When we were done individually we worked together to create pipelines and coherent presentations of our work.
